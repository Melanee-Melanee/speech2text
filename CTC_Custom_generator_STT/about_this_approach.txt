in this approach we decided to implement CTC for Speech to text.

here we created a custom data generator but for better experince try tf.data

NOTE : This implementation was heavily inspired by UDACITY speech recognition Course. Thanks to community
for sharing their implementations. 

Note2 : this sample code is trained on turkish language. feel free to use in other languages too.
     I have commented codes that should be changed for other languages.

Steps :
     1- preprocess Audios( I used Spectrogram, but you can use MFCC. There are comments which I said
     how to change the code if you want to use MFCC). 
     
     2- Preprocess the Texts. we will tokenize the words in character level mode. We will have one more symbol than all of our characters. that is because CTC need  
     special blank character.

     3- Feed preprocessed Audios to our model and loop over it.
