"""
    In this code I'll show you how to use speech_recognition lib for persian and english files.
    this library is used to transcribe your audio files. and can use many WebSerivces like :
    Google,IBM,Microsoft,..

    Here I used google speech recognition

    TIP : Google cloud speech recognition is different from google speech recognition
    NOTE: You need INTERNET access to use google speech recognition.
    NOTE : YOUR AUDIO TYPE MUST BE in WAV Format
