# Part of Our Dataset V0.1 üìÅ
Here in Hamtech Company, we decided to open source a challenging part of our ASR dataset. This Dataset is near 30 Hours of voice plus CSV file which includes the transcription. you can find a column named Confidence_level, this means how much the transcription is reliable, here is the, you can use LM(language models) or any other idea to clean them or any other ideas. The variety of speakers in this dataset is not so much But the quality of voices is good enough. In conclusion :

* Dataset is near 30H
* Transcriptions are not an exact match. 
* Variety of speakers in this dataset is not so much
* You may use some techniques ( like using LMs, using annotator, etc. ) to clean more the transcription
* you can use the confidence_level column in the CSV file to select more accurate rows.
* wav files are nearly 2Gb. 
* voices format is : format : Wav / channels : mono/ sample_rate : 16000 Hz/ 
* Google drive dataset URL is https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BLOYLBOUSWI50k4RTnpTc7Ni4rYxjVi2?usp=sharing
* to download just the CSV file check current folder or the [google drive link ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vqvn0F0YYhEFbzLgP9wJ36vyInUnO5b5/view?usp=sharing)
