this is a simple guid for how to create your own data for this .


Split your audio files to sentence length (say 1 - 15 seconds).
 Then create three files, one for training (train.csv), one for development testing (dev.csv),
  one for evaluation testing (test.csv). The file names are arbitrary. The first line of each
   must contain column declarations, and there must be at least these columns:

wav_filename,wav_filesize,transcript

There can be any number of other columns if you need them. The subsequent lines contain the data in
 the order defined by the header line.

wav_filename corresponds to the path to the audio relative to the csv file.
wav_filesize is the number of bytes of the audio file.
transcript is the transcript limited to your alphabet.
A sample of a file could be:

wav_filename,wav_filesize,transcript
clips/sentence1.wav,16444,the cat sat on the mat
clips/sentence2.wav,21010,the bat shat on the cat
The size ratio of train:dev:test is usually 8:1:1, but thatâ€™s more of
 a convention than a generally optimal number.

The audio files must be standard WAV, 16kHz, mono.
