This project is about building Speech Recognition System. We tried to cover useful techniques and implementations and to create good guid for developers who want develope such a system. In this repository we mentioned all the articles, github repos, and other sources for you too ( See Tutorial ). Type of models we used are : [ Attention mechanism, CTC , Teacher Forcing]

## Starting 🚀

To have a copy of these project and retune it ( or change the structure if you want ) you need to have GPU for better experience, install some libraries and also You need DATA. We used Mozilla Deep Speech data ( shape of csv ) you can download them freely. [Mozilla Deep Spech data](https://voice.mozilla.org/en/datasets). <br>
And Also if you want to go in depth of theories and more, you can check Tutorial Folder for links to sources and theories, articles and more.<br><br>
See **Deployment, Tutorial, Installation** to learn more about the project.


## About Folders 📁

in each directory you can find a *.txt file which help you to know what is this folder for and how it can help you. make sure you read this txt file first

## Prerequisites 📋

You need to know about RNNs, Attention mechanism, CTC, a little pandas/numpy, Tensorflow and KERAS. and also knowing about Spectrograms, MFCC, Filter Bank will help you to understand preprocess of audios. nothing more <br><br>
if you don't know any of these stuff you can check Tutorial Folder or search in web


## Installation 🔧

Some libraries you need to install. I'll list them here ( These are the most important ) : <br>
* ffmpeg
* pydub
* python_speech_features
* numpy
* pandas
* tensorflow
* sklearn
<br> <br>
In next line I'll show how to install three of them ( I used these commands to install in Kaggle Notebooks too.)<br>
`` 
pip install pydub
`` 
`` 
pip install python_speech_features
`` 
`` 
!apt-get install -y ffmpeg
`` 



## Running tests ⚙️

If you install all the libraries and your csv file is in right format you will test the code easily.



## Deployment 📦

Soon...

## Built with 🛠️

As I mentioned before ( in installation ) we used some libs and frameworks : 

* Tensorflow
* Keras
* ffmpeg
* pydub 
* python speech features
