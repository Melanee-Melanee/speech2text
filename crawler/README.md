# Crawler

this folder contain my crawler to crawl radio data.
<br>

TIP : check here "http://radio.iranseda.ir/" for radio archive. choose the page to your selected programm like this one : http://radio.iranseda.ir/Program/?VALID=TRUE&ch=19&m=094156

So . first link ( "http://radio.iranseda.ir/"  ) is constant. this is radio url. And second url is the program url you want to download.

Tip : You have to change 2 names. first one is the name of programm you are crawling. second one is the url to your program ( as described above). 

## Run the code ⚙️
after changing those 2 variables. run it. nothing more :)
